# Unit 4 - Personal Narrative

## Introduction

Images are often used to portray our personal experiences and interests. We also use image filters and effects to change or enhance the mood of an image. When combined into collages and presentations, these images tell a story about who we are and what is important to us. Your goal is to create a personal narrative using The Theater that consists of images of your personal experiences and/or interests, incorporates data related to these experiences and/or interests that can be organized in a 2D array, and uses image filters and effects to change or enhance the mood of your images.

## Requirements

Use your knowledge of object-oriented programming, two-dimensional (2D) arrays, and algorithms to create your personal narrative collage or animation:

- **Create at least two 2D arrays** – Create at least two 2D arrays to store the data that will make up your visualization.
- **Implement one or more algorithms** – Implement one or more algorithms that use loops and two-way or multi-selection statements with compound Boolean expressions to analyze the data.
- **Use Image Filters** - Include multiple image filters learned from this unit, and additionally create new ones of your own.
- **Use methods in the String class** – Use one or more methods in the String class in your program, such as to determine whether the name of an image file contains specific characters.
- **Create a visualization** – Create an image or animation that conveys the story of the data by illustrating the patterns or relationships in the data.
- **Document your code** – Use comments to explain the purpose of the methods and code segments and note any preconditions and postconditions.

## Story Description

My project is based on otters and the otter facts based on the species. The theater runner showcases different scenes, the first being of the first two species of otters, the sea otter and north american river otter. They are set as new ImageFilter images, along with their .png file names. The iformation being given for these two otters is their populations. This is given by the information 2D array. This array gives populations of the first two otters in the first row, the heights for the third and fourth otter in the second row, and the lifespans for the fifth and sixth otter in the third row. Along with the filter on the images, the 

## Image Filter Analysis

In the first scene, two iages have a filter put on them. They go from their regular appearaace to being filtered to look red. This is done by setting the RGB pixels to different amounts. Using the .keepColor() method, and setting the parameter to red, the blue and green pixels in the image are set to 0. This is what gives the image the red appearance, and allows the image to be filtered.
